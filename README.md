# Flight System Algorithm and Pathfinding

This Java project implements graph algorithms for optimizing flight system routes using Dijkstra's algorithm. It calculates the shortest paths and handles circular routes through specified points.

## Features

- **Graph Algorithms:** Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
- **Circular Pathfinding:** Computes circular paths that include a specific point.
- **Efficient Input Handling:** Reads and processes input from text files to construct and analyze graphs.

## Classes

- **Graph:** Manages the graph structure and edge additions.
- **Bag:** Represents the adjacency list for the graph.
- **Main:** Handles input reading, graph construction, and pathfinding operations.
